/*
 Remove Dups: Write code to remove duplicates from an unsorted linked list.
 approach : From head to tail iterate through the list to remove index [i] element's duplicate.
 if there are no duplicate, this will run at n-square time.
 FOLLOW UP
 How would you solve this problem if a temporary buffer is not allowed?
 for follow up I would sort the list (bubble sort since the problem restriction is no temp buffer).
 and then compare adjacent nodes to remove dups.

/*2.3
 Delete Middle Node: Implement an algorithm to delete a node in the middle (any node but
 the first and last node, not necessarily the exact middle) of a singly linked list, given only access to
 that node.
 
 Hint given->Picture the list 1->5->9->12, Removing 9 would make it look like 1- >5- >12.You only
 have access to the 9 node. Can you make it iook like the correct answer?
 
 Approach #1 : Since we are given only access to the targeted node
 Step1 : Copy contents of next link to itself.
 step2: Copy next link's next to itself.
 step3: delete the tailing node.

 *
 Sum Lists: You have two numbers represented by a linked list,
 where each node contains a single digit.
 The digits are stored in reverse order,
 such that the Vs digit is at the head of the list.
 Write a function that adds the two numbers and returns the sum as a linked list.
 
 For this problem, I have quickly implemented pop and push for the list,
 and SumList will have summing of a list of digits in reverse order.
 
 Thus from driver program,
 User will have access to SumList which will sum the list that contains
 reverse order digits
 User also has access to IntToList which will convert an integer value
 to reverser order digit representation in a List.
