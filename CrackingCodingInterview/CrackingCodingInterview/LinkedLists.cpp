/*
 Remove Dups: Write code to remove duplicates from an unsorted linked list.
 approach : From head to tail iterate through the list to remove index [i] element's duplicate.
 if there are no duplicate, this will run at n-square time.
 FOLLOW UP
 How would you solve this problem if a temporary buffer is not allowed?
 for follow up I would sort the list (bubble sort since the problem restriction is no temp buffer).
 and then compare adjacent nodes to remove dups.

/*2.3
 Delete Middle Node: Implement an algorithm to delete a node in the middle (any node but
 the first and last node, not necessarily the exact middle) of a singly linked list, given only access to
 that node.
 
 Hint given->Picture the list 1->5->9->12, Removing 9 would make it look like 1- >5- >12.You only
 have access to the 9 node. Can you make it iook like the correct answer?
 
 Approach #1 : Since we are given only access to the targeted node
 Step1 : Copy contents of next link to itself.
 step2: Copy next link's next to itself.
 step3: delete the tailing node.
