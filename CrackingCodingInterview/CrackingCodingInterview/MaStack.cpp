/* 3.1
 Q: Describe how you could use a single array to implement three stacks.
 A: in a single array we can use modulus and division to browse through stack
 stack operation push would be done through accessing to [n], [n+1], or [n+2]
 stack operation pop can be done through accessing to [n], [n+1], or [n+2]
 thus index would run [stack 1],[stack 2],[stack 3], repeat.
 Given an index, we can identify which stack the index belongs to
 if each stack contains significantly different size, this indexing would cause
 inefficient space allocation.

/* 3.2
 Q: Stack Min - How would you design a stack which, in addtion to push and pop, has a function
 min which returns the minimum element. Push, pop and min should all operate in O(1) time.
 A: since stack is based on LIFO, A pointer to top which will push element in at O(1),
 pop element in O(1). While push and pop are kept normal operation keeping a pointer to min value
 for each operation for push and pop by updating min pointer
 while push can remain at O(1) by adding one comparsion to update the min to incoming value
 pop will require re locating the min value of from the whole remaining stack if it was the min
 that got popped from the stack. Thus the book's solution was to keep an additional stack of min
 which I did not quite understand, and other suggestion was to keep a pointer to min of each node.
 Which can also fail to provide O(1) because of the complication when updating pop for min

/* 3.3
 Stack of Plates
 Implement a data structure SetOFStacks that mimics real life stacks of plates.
 SetOfStacks should be composed of several stacks and should create a new stack once the previous ones exceed
 its capacity. SetOfStacks.push() and SetOfStacks.pop() should behave identically to a single stac.
 
 Additionally implement a function popAt(int index) which performs a pop operation on a specific sub-stack
